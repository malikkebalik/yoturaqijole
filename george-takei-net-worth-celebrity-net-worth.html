His parents, Fumiko and Takekuma, were Japanese-American, and his father owned a dry-cleaning business, then a grocery store, before going into real estate. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, armed soldiers forced the family to leave their home, and they were sent to an internment camp in Arkansas, the Rohwer War Relocation Center. The Takeis were later sent to California's Tule Lake War Relocation Center. Many of George's relatives lived in Japan during World War II, and an aunt and infant cousin were killed during the bombing of Hiroshima.</p><p>When the war ended in 1945, the Takei family was released from the internment camp, but they no longer had a home, business, or bank accounts, leading them to live on Skid Row until 1950. George studied at Mount Vernon Junior High School and graduated from Los Angeles High School, where he was Boys Division President. He studied architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, then transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in theater in 1960, followed by a Master of Arts in theater four years later. Takei also took classes at England's Shakespeare Institute at Stratford-upon-Avon, Toyko's Sophia University, and Hollywood's Desilu Workshop.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-168516 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/George-Takei.jpg alt="George Takei" width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-168516 class=wp-caption-text>Brad Barket/Getty Images</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>George began his Hollywood career doing voiceover work on the English-dubbed versions of the Japanese monster movies "Rodan!

Brunton, a former model and actor, accused George of drugging and groping him in 1981. Takei denied Brunton's allegation, stating, "Non-consensual acts are so antithetical to my values and my practices, the very idea that someone would accuse me of this is quite personally painful." Brunton later changed his story and said he didn't actually remember George touching his genitals, and toxicologists explained that based on Bruton's version of events, he most likely suffered from postural hypotension, not a drugged drink. Takei publicly forgave Brunton in May 2018.</p><h2 id=awards-honors><strong>Awards and Honors</strong></h2><p>In 2014, the GLAAD Media Awards honored George with the Vito Russo Award, and he received the Timeless Award from the GALECA: The Society of LGBTQ Entertainment Critics the following year.
