Log in.</span></span><p class=premium>I grew up on Oahu and live here now as an adult and feel like I'm in on a well-kept secret that Hawaii is home to some of the best food in the world.&nbsp;From old-school eateries that have been around for decades to new spots that rival the trendy restaurants opening in New York, my favorite places to eat are often rooted in a strong sense of place and take inspiration from the local ingredients of Hawaii, like haupia (coconut) and fresh seafood.</p><p class=premium>In my opinion, the best things to eat feature local ingredients prominently, so you'll eat particularly well if you prioritize the places serving dishes that you can't easily find on the mainland and are very tied to Hawaii's history.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>For centuries, Native Hawaiians sustained themselves from the land and sea with food like poi (taro root fermented, baked, and then pounded into a paste-like consistency), but <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>European colonization</a> led to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>industrialization</a> of Hawaii's land into sugar and pineapple plantations, which brought in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>immigrants</a> from places like Portugal, Japan, and China to work laborers, bringing over foods like rice, li hing mui (sour plum) and pao doce (Portugese sweet bread).</p><p class=premium>As a result, the local cuisine is now a combination of Asian and Pacific flavors plus a dash of Western influence that you likely can't find anywhere else. Think pan-seared ahi steak seasoned with furikake (Japanese sesame and seaweed seasoning) served with a creamy dip and sides of white rice and mac salad (the best place to get it is at Nico's, more on that below).&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>Most of all, I strongly believe in supporting local businesses, especially as a visitor. It not only provides an authentic experience, but you'll also give back to the place you're visiting, which is especially important considering Hawaii's history.</p><p class=premium>If you're ready to plan the ultimate Hawaiian gastronomic journey, here are 13 of my favorite locally-owned food and drink spots to try.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Off the Hook Poke Market is my go-to spot for fresh poke.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>For a fresh ahi tuna bowl, head to Off the Hook Poke Market. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Off the Hook Poke Market</span></span></figure><p>Unless you don't eat raw fish, I would be sorely disappointed if you came to Oahu (or Hawaii in general) and didn't make it a priority to try poke. It is a staple dish for locals, and my favorite post-beach meal.&nbsp;</p><p>Although raw cubed fish can be found on the mainland, in my opinion, that's far from the original poke that comes from Hawaii. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module=body_link>Off the Hook Poke Market</a> serves some of the freshest ahi tuna poke I've ever had in the lush valley of Manoa. It gets incredibly tender fish each morning from the fish market, and I think the spicy ahi offers the right balance of spice and creaminess. Just prepare to wait in a long line.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>For refreshing and natural acai bowls, I go to Haleiwa Bowls.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>If you're craving a delicious bowl of fruit, you have to visit Haleiwa Bowls. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Michelle Mishina for Insider</span></span></figure><p>If I'm surfing up on the North Shore, eventually, the hot sun and salty water make me crave a refreshing acai bowl topped with fresh fruit, granola, raw coconut flakes, and raw local honey. I'll make a stop at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module=body_link>Haleiwa</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module=body_link> Bowls</a> on my way back to town and pick up a mana bowl, which has blended acai and all those delicious toppings. The blue majik bowl is also aesthetically pleasing and has a blended base of pineapple and banana turned baby blue thanks to blue majik spirulina.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Helena's Hawaiian Food is an authentic Hawaiian eatery known for their kalua pig.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Helena's Hawaiian Food serves beautifully plated traditional meals. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Michelle Mishina for Insider</span></span></figure><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module=body_link>Helena's Hawaiian Food</a> is a staple for authentic Hawaiian food. It opened in 1946 and has earned multiple awards. If you eat meat, consider ordering kalua pig, which is a pig traditionally cooked in an underground oven called an imu.</p><p>I love lau lau, which is meat cooked until tender in ti leaves, and eaten with white rice or poi. Don't leave without ordering haupia for dessert — it's a pudding-like dessert that's creamy without being too sweet.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Tiny Pyramid is a French-style bakery inspired by local flavors.</h2><p>Tucked into a nondescript shopping center away from tourists, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module=body_link>Tiny Pyramid</a> is for all sweet tooths. This family-owned bistro and bakery has over 40 delicate-looking French-style pastries inspired by local ingredients.</p><p>My favorites include the sweet potato and haupia (coconut) mousse over a white sponge cake and a lilikoi (passionfruit) cheesecake. Chocolate lovers will find themselves in heaven over their chocolate mac-nut tart.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Hana Koa Brewing Co. uses local island flavors for their beers.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Hana Koa Brewing Co. offers a selection of creative and flavorful brews. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Michelle Mishina for Insider</span></span></figure><p>I'm proud of Hawaii's beer scene and mention it to visitors every chance I get because our local brewers make creative brews using flavors unique to the islands. Stop by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module=body_link>Hana Koa Brewing Co<strong>.</strong></a> in the trendy former warehouse neighborhood of Kakaako, which was opened in 2019 by a man with Native Hawaiian heritage and his wife, whom he met on the mainland.</p><p>Their Dortmunder Mifflin is a German-style lager with hints of fresh papaya and honeycomb. If you're not a fan of beer, you'll be satisfied with their seltzer flavors as well. They also often collaborate with other local businesses like the Rice Factory, a specialty Japanese rice shop in Honolulu.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>My favorite spot for an affordable plate lunch is Pioneer Saloon.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A traditional plate lunch includes ride, macaroni, and protein. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Shutterstock/Bonchan</span></span></figure><p>In Hawaii, a plate lunch is an affordable, filling meal consisting of a scoop of rice, macaroni salad, and a protein like barbecue pork or chicken katsu. They're perfect for a post-hike lunch or to take to the beach. My favorite place to get a plate lunch is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module=body_link>Pioneer Saloon</a>, which has two locations in Honolulu.</p><p>I highly recommend the ahi katsu, which is fried ahi served with tartar and ponzu sauce. It also has an ono loco moco, a local favorite of a hamburger steak and two sunny-side-up eggs over a bed of rice, drizzled in a decadent curry-gravy-like sauce.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Snacking on refreshing shave ice from Waiola Shave Ice is my go-to on a hot day.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-only><span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Michelle Mishina for Insider</span></span></figure><p>I grew up eating the local snack of shave ice (no, it's not "shaved") on the hottest afternoons. My mom would always drive my sister and me to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module=body_link>Waiola Shave Ice</a> on Waiola Street in Honolulu after school for a sweet treat. As adults, my sister and I will still always stop at the original Waiola after a blazing beach day (there's another location in Kapahulu).</p><p>Their shave ice is finely ground, and they pour enough syrup so you're never left with that dreaded plain icy center. They have an overwhelming number of flavors, ranging from classic pineapple and coconut to the more creative pickled mango and li hing mui (a sour plum treat). I highly recommend getting your shave ice with condensed milk drizzled on top or with a scoop of ice cream at the bottom.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Overlooking the ocean, Mina's Fish House is unique for having a fish sommelier.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A fresh catch at Mina's Fish House at the Four Seasons Resort in Oahu. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Courtesy of Four Seasons Ko Olina</span></span></figure><p>Overlooking the water at the Four Seasons Resort Oahu at Ko Olina on the west side of Oahu, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module=body_link>Mina's Fish House</a> is one of the only restaurants in the world to have fish sommeliers. In a way, it makes sense since people's livelihoods in Hawaii have long been tied to the ocean.&nbsp;</p><p>I ate here in 2022 for the first time and was blown away by the fish sommelier's knowledge and love for the ocean as he explained the daily catch in detail. If you order the whole-fish catch of the day, he even comes back to cut it for you. Mina's Fish House is pricey, but the experience — and the food — is worth it.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>I grew up eating at Side Street Inn, which has large servings of local dishes.</h2><p>I grew up making frequent visits to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module=body_link>Side Street Inn</a>, and my dad always makes sure we hit this beloved local spot when he's in town because their food is straightforward, delicious, and the servings are huge.&nbsp;</p><p>This award-winning restaurant has two locations that have been around for years and might look familiar if you've seen Anthony Bourdain's "No Reservations." Tuck into whopping platters of local staples like sizzling kalbi, garlic chicken, chicken katsu, and fried rice with Portuguese sausage and char-siu, which is a Chinese barbecue pork.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Hau Tree is a beachside restaurant that I think makes for a romantic dinner.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Eat your meal right on the beach at Hau Tree. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Michelle Mishina for Insider</span></span></figure><p>Located on the edge of Waikiki in the Kaimana Hotel, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module=body_link>Hau Tree</a> is right on the beach, providing a beautiful setting to catch the sunset. I recommend couples reserve a date night here, which has mouthwatering libations such as the Kapua fizz, which mixes gin with calamansi, a lime native to the Philippines, and absinthe.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>I stop into any Foodland grocery store for lunch from the poke counter.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Foodland is a grocery chain in Hawaii with a poke counter. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Shutterstock/EQRoy</span></span></figure><p>Did you know that you can get some of Hawaii's best poke in a grocery store? Head over to the poke counter at any <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module=body_link>Foodland</a>, which is found across the island, to grab some fish for the beach. I'm a fan of the Spicy Hawaiian, which combines limu (seaweed) with spicy mayo. If you get a poke bowl, ask for furikake on the rice.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Leonard's Bakery is a beachside food truck serving Portuguese-inspired desserts.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>If you're looking to try Portuguese-inspired desserts, watch out for this retro truck known as Leonard's Bakery. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Michelle Mishina for Insider</span></span></figure><p>Recognizable by its iconic, retro-looking sign, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module=body_link>Leonard's Bakery</a> is famous for its malasadas, which are donuts with Portuguese origins that are fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. It's served warm in a pink plastic bag or box, and if you're a fan of indulgence, I recommend trying the one filled with haupia cream.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Nico's Pier 38 is a longtime favorite of my family's for great seafood.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>My family keeps coming back for more at Nico's Pier 38. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Michelle Mishina for Insider</span></span></figure><p>Seafood in Hawaii shines for obvious reasons. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module=body_link>Nico's Pier 38</a> is another great place to eat fresh seafood and a longtime favorite of my family.
