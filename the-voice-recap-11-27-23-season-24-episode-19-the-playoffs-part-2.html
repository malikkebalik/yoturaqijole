below.</p><p>On tonight’s The Voice season 24 episode 19 as per the NBC synopsis, “Each coach has a “Super Save” enabling them to return an artist from any team to join them in the playoffs in the hopes of making the live shows. The six artists remaining on Team Reba and Team Gwen hold nothing back as tough decisions are made.”</p><p>So make sure to bookmark this spot and come back for our The Voice recap between 8 PM – 10 PM ET! While you wait for the recap make sure to check out all our <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Voice spoilers, news, videos, recaps</a>&nbsp;& more, right here!</p><p><strong>Tonight’s The Voice recap begins now – Refresh Page often to get the most current updates!</strong></p><p>Tonight’s episode of #TheVoice, the Playoffs continued tonight. Team Reba was up first. She was already down one player because Tom Nitti had to leave for personal reasons, but that also helped to keep one other person on her team. Someone that wants to be there more than anything. Reba had Jordan Rainer opening tonight with her rendition of “Boondocks”. She loves Jordan. She loves her stage presence. Jordan was a four chair turn. She has a great voice. She didn’t need much coaching. She was perfect for Reba’s team and so Reba did her best to keep her around.</p><p>Jordan put on a stellar performance. Both her voice and her banjo skills were top notch. She kept everyone entertained. This included the judges and so all she needed was for people to believe in her. For her coach to believe she can win with her. Reba’s next pick was Ms. Monet. Ms. Monet was her Super Save. She’s already saved her once and so there’s no telling what she’ll decide to do with the wonderful skills that Ms. Monet possessed. Ms. Monet chose “Until You Come Back to Me”. She knew what it was like to be eliminated and that pushed her to give the greatest performance she could tonight.</p><p>John felt it was a little much. He told her that she could dial it back while Niall disagreed. Niall said that was the most confident he’d ever seen Ms. Monet be. The Super Save gave her a much-needed boost. Niall felt her performance was flawless and he couldn’t wait to see more from her. Ms. Monet finally had a time to shine on her own. Not as a backup singer. Next up was Jacquie Roar. Jacquie has great energy. She wants to do Country Rock. She wishes to combine those two fields into one and she did so with a great song tonight.</p><p>Jacquie chose “The Chain”. She was another that gave her song her everything and impressed quite a lot of people with her performance. John said tonight was his favorite performance of hers. Gwen felt bad at having let her go. She had Jacquie on her team at one time and she made the stupid mistake of letting Reba steal her. Niall along with Reba gave her a standing ovation. They loved that Jacquie could hit the high notes one second then drop it back to a quiet tone in the next. Reba said it took a lot of skill to do that.</p><p>Reba had Noah Spencer go next. Noah was more of a Country/Folk musician. Tonight, he chose to combine both fields with his rendition of “Jolene”. It was a big song. It was a Dolly Parton classic only Noah rearranged the song to fit his Folk vibe. He also accompanied himself on guitar. He truly turned the song into his own with his rendition. It sounded like an original. His skillset was undeniable with this song. He has the potential to win and it doesn’t have to be on Reba’s team. Remember he started off on Team Niall.</p><p>Noah could go far no matter whose team he’s on. Next up was Ruby Leigh. Ruby has this old timey voice. She was true Country. She was also sixteen. She needed to work on an emotional connection because she has no idea what its like to experience heartbreak or to hit bottom. She was a kid. A very talented kid. Ruby chose the song “Long Long Time”. Reba loved it in rehearsals and she started the conspiracy theory that Ruby was much older than sixteen. At sixteen, Reba was focused on playing basketball. And here was Ruby already knowing her purpose.</p><p>The performance that Ruby gave had moved everyone to tears. She broke Reba’s heart with that song. They all loved her and they felt her voice could heal the world. Reba loved everyone’s performance. It was therefore hard when Reba had to cut some of them. She couldn’t take them all and so she chose to save Jordan, Jacquie, and Ruby. Reba felt these three women had what it takes to win. It sucks that she had to lose Ms. Monet and Noah. And so the door remains open for next year in case anyone’s wondering.</p><p>It was then Team Gwen’s turn to push her people through the Playoffs. She put Stee up first. He was a Steal from John’s team and he has great range. He chose the song “Shut Up And Dance With Me” tonight. He sang it flawlessly, but the song needed a little grit. It was Pop Rock and that’s still Rock at the end of the day. Stee sang the song with a fun upbeat. He could have done more if he had listened to Gwen during the rehearsals. Not that Gwen had any complaints. She still enjoyed his performance. Stee showed that he could perform just about anything.</p><p>Gwen had to decide if his versatility was useful in the live shows. Next up was Bias. Bias was a rarity. He has a unique voice and he loves to tell a story with it. He chose the song “Where I Found God”. He said it spoke to him. Bias was the only Country artist on Gwen’s team and he felt he had to represent. He has some missteps in rehearsal. He got a little too lost in the storytelling. He forgot it was a prayer as well as a confession. Bias worked to correct that and he sounded great tonight. He impressed Reba. He even impressed Niall and John.</p><p>Bias’s performance showed another side to him. He usually goes for the big numbers and tonight he showed that he could do the quiet tone. He could do the heartfelt tone. Plus, everyone really loved his outfit. Gwen’s team was great at versatility and that was going to be an issue down the road if she didn’t make the right choices tonight. Rudi was up next. She recently lost her aunt to cancer. Her Aunt Mary has been struggling with cancer for a long time now and sadly she lost the fight a few days before Rudi’s rehearsals.</p><p>Rudi could have fallen apart. She instead chose to focus her pain into music. She was Spanish and her aunt always told her to sing a song in Spanish for her. So, that’s what Rudi did tonight. She chose the song “My All”. She sang it in both English and Spanish. She showed range. She also gave a sensuous vibe that set the tone for her whole performance. Reba loved that she was a storyteller. Niall said she got better and better throughout the entire performance. And so everyone was making it hard for Gwen.</p><p>Tanner Massey went next. He was another young one. He was in LA by himself for the first time. He usually travels with his parents and right now they were enjoying their first taste of being empty nesters. They’ve already given his room to the dog. They were that sure that he’d win. Gwen was also sure that he could win. She said he was the most likely to succeed after the show on her team. Its why she gave Tanner the best advice she could. He chose the song “Impossible”. His rendition was very moving.</p><p>Tanner won over allies after that. He was also a little cutie. He will go far just with that face alone. Next up was Lennon VanderDoes. He was Gwen’s Super Save. He wanted to prove he deserved to stay and that’s why he chose the song “Falling Slowly”. Lennon wanted to play that song on guitar. Only he was playing over his voice during rehearsals. Gwen caught that. She told him about it and he worked on lessening that though he still didn’t want to give up the guitar. He eventually found a middle ground for both voice and guitar.</p><p>Lennon gave a great performance. He was a singer/songwriter. He’s proven that Gwen can continue to work with him. Gwen doesn’t have anyone else like him on her team and there was still one more performance to go. Next and last for Team Gwen was Kara Tenae. She gets better with each performance and has the best stage presence out of everyone on Gwen’s team. She chose the song “Rain” for her performance tonight. She needed a few notes during the rehearsals and then she would go kill it during the performance itself. Like she always does.</p><p>Kara also looks great with each performance. She’s always dressed to impress. Her outfit tonight was killer. She looked the best out of everyone. Her voice was great and she set a tone. She could be playful on top of sensuous. Kara is consistently at her best. Even Gwen said as much. Gwen chose to keep Kara, Bias, and Tanner out of everyone tonight. They represent different genres. They can all attract people to their side. And so Gwen was being very savvy with her picks tonight.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnpJ2ybsLOopqeZaKasKK8jGpoZmpnYn90edKemKynnmJ%2FdXnEqaCsp5SaenKFjK2fnmWgoa66u8WfqmaokafBbn6O</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-is-streamer-5up-real-name-face-reveal-age-wiki-and-instagram.html>&#171;&nbsp;What Is Streamer 5up Real Name?
