He completed an alcohol diversion program, and the charges were dropped. He was charged with DUI again in 2007 after a Washington County Sheriff's Deputy claimed that Matt drove outside the travel lane after he left a bar. Roloff said that he was having a hard time controlling the vehicle because it was fitted for Amy and that he was just dropping someone off at the bar. Matt pleaded not guilty, and the case was dismissed because of jury misconduct.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>As we mentioned earlier in this article, in 1990 Matt and Amy bought their first portion of what would eventually become a 109-acre property in Helvetia, Oregon. They paid $185,000 for the first parcel, eventually buying multiple neighboring parcels. They built a 4,500 square-foot primary home on the property while also eventually adding a number of unique attractions to the grounds. The grounds now include:</p><ul><li>Children's play castle the size of a small home</li><li>40 foot pirate ship that features several bedrooms</li><li>A replica western town featuring a jail, post office, bank and barbershop</li><li>Replica mountain range</li><li>3,600 square-foot barn</li></ul><p>Matt and Amy continued to co-own the property after their 2006 divorce but in 2019 Matt bought Amy out of her share.</p><p>In 2022 Matt put the primary 16-acre section of the property, featuring all of the above amenities, on the market for $4 million.
