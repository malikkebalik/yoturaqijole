But the wedding did not happen today; the coy couple tricked everyone and wed back in February of this year.</p><p>The 46-year-old Klum and 29 -year- old wed back in February and maintained complete secrecy about the issue. The wedding took place two months after Kaulitz proposed to Klum on December 24, 2018.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Debby Ryan Biography- Age, Height, Movies, Husband, Twitter, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>When previously asked about her wedding, Heidi said they were still in preparation. And like that, the model was successful in trolling the media and the fans both. Anyway, we wish the couple blissful married life.</p><h2>Early Life and Childhood</h2><p>On June 1, 1973, Heidi Klum was born in Bergisch Gladbach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. She is the daughter of Erna Klum and grew up with his brother Michael Klum. Similarly, Klum holds both German and American citizenship. The latter was claimed much later in 2008.</p><p>Talking about her education, Heidi has only completed her High School study. Soon after her graduation, Heidi won the modeling contest called ‘Model 92‘ and received<strong> $300,000</strong> worth of modeling contract. Because of it, the young Klum chose not to try for an apprentice position at a fashion design school. That outstanding decision proved to be the right one as now Heidi’s career flourished as a model.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Trey Kennedy : Career, Partner & Net Worth>></strong></a></p><h2>Age and Measurements</h2><p>The supermodel celebrated her 46th birthday just early this month. Even more, Klum stands tall at the height of 5 feet 9 inches(176cm) and weighs around 62 kg(136 lbs), which is hard to believe because the model is the mother of four children.</p><p>Similarly, Heidi is blessed with the genes that give her a youthful look. Her fair skin complexion with brown eyes further accentuates her beauty. Also, she was naturally born with brown hair but colored it blonde, which suits her even more.</p><h2>Career: Runway and Acting</h2><p>Heidi and modeling were a perfect match as both complimented each other well. The young star rose as a model gracing the cover of French, German, Portuguese Vogue, including Elle, InStyle, Marie Claire, Glamour, and Harper’s Bazaar magazines. But she was widely known for appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and as a Victoria’s Secret Angel. Sadly, Klum left Victoria’s Secret Angel in 2010.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameron Boyce Death Cause, Age, Height, Jesse, Girlfriend, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Heidi was more suited as an editorial model than as a runway model. Also, Heidi is commercially successful who has made an appearance in many tv shows and movies. The internet personality has appeared in Spin City(1999), Sex and the City(2001), CSI: Miami(2003), How I Met Your Mother(2007), Desperate Housewives(2010), Parks and Recreation(2013), Ocean’s 8(2018) and many more.</p><p>Moreover, the supermodel Heidi hosted the show Project Runway where her iconic line ‘One day you’re in, next day you’re out ‘ was born. She hosted the show from 2004-2017 and is still active as the host of Germany’s Next Topmodel since 2006. Besides this, the 46-year-old was also the judge of America’s Got Talent for six seasons from season 8-13.</p><h2>Entrepreneur and Other Business Venture</h2><p>Other than modeling and acting, Heidi is also equally a talented entrepreneur. She launched her clothing line on April 30, 2008. The model also designed makeup for Victoria’s Secret and launched two fragrances called ‘Heidi Klum‘ and ‘Me.‘ In 2017, Heidi released the fashion line Heidi & the City, which was presented at the New York Fashion Week.</p><p>Klum is also an artist and author of her two books. She released ‘Heidi Klum’s Body of Knowledge’ in 2004 and ‘Project Life’ in 2011. Moreover, Heidi sang in the duet ‘Wedding Day’ with her ex-husband <strong>Seal</strong>.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johanna Konta Bio- Age, Height, Tennis, Ranking, Husband, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Furthermore, Klum is also a philanthropist, and on April 30, 2011, Klum led Walk for Kids campaign to raise awareness for the Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles.</p><h2>Personal Life: Husbands and Children</h2><p>As mentioned already, Heidi is no longer single and is married to Tom Kaulitz, who is 17 years younger than the model.</p><p>But this is not Heidi’s first marriage; in fact, Heidi has been married twice before this event. In 1997, Klum married hairstylist <strong>Ric Pipino</strong> but got separated in 2002. After that, Klum dated Italian racecar team manager<strong> Flavio Briatore</strong> and welcomed their first child, <strong>Leni,</strong> in May of 2004.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/heidi-0001.jpg><p>Unfortunately, the pair split, and Klum began dating musician Seal. The couple got engaged in December 2004 and married on May 10, 2005. They welcomed three children together,<strong> Henry Gunther Ademola Dashtu Samuel</strong> in 2005, <strong>Johan Riley Fyodor Taiwo Samuel</strong> in 2006, and youngest daughter<strong> Lou Sulola Samuel</strong> in 2009.</p><p>But even they could not last long and got separated after seven years of marriage. On October 14, 2014, they officially divorced and went separate ways.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Is Wang Yibo Gay?

She mainly earns from hosting shows and appearing as a cameo.
