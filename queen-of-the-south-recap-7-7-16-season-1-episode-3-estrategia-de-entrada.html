Camila’s belief that Teresa is much more important than Epifanio is admitting intensifies after she is told that Epifanio has people searching for Teresa all over the U.S. and Mexico. In the holding cell, Teresa has been moved to a holding cell with other mules, a dubious promotion in her new world. She encounters hostility from the other mules. She retrieves her cell phone, discovering that she has multiple messages from Brenda, who, along with her son Tony, are being hunted by the same people that killed Guero and Chino.

Teresa tells her to destroy her phone and head to “the crazy green place.” Brenda destroys her phone as the men pull up on the street next to her. Running for her life, she and Tony steal a car and flee the area.In the holding cell, James confronts Teresa about her attempts to make herself valuable to Camila and warns that doing so will make it harder for her to get out of the drug game.

Asking what she is supposed do, James tells her to do small things for Camila when she asks and that Teresa will then be awarded.

When asking for Brenda, Teresa describes her as the woman who likes the crazy green nail polish. Teresa tells Brenda to take the money she has to buy a burner phone and find someone to get her and Tony across the border and into Texas.</p><p>Back at the warehouse, James spots a suspicious worker and questions his contact on the identity of the unknown man. Outside, still on the phone with Brenda, the DEA suddenly pull Teresa out of the car and throw her in the back of a van. The DEA agents inside the van question her about whether she works for Camila. Teresa refuses to say Camila’s name, denying that she works for anyone. It is then revealed that the people interrogating her are not really DEA agents but people who work for Camila. Exiting the van, Teresa sees Camila herself standing in the parking lot. Camila tells Teresa that she is impressed with her so far but had to see whether or not she could be fully trusted.</p><p>James again warns Teresa about Camila being dangerous. Despite his warnings, Teresa insists being involved in the drug transaction so that she can become even more valuable to Camila.</p><p>Camila’s lawyer, Teo Aljarafe, meets with her in a restaurant. They discuss a retail transaction that will help Camila expand her reach. Aljarafe confronts Camila about her husband’s drug trafficking business and expresses his reluctance to do anything that would anger a man as powerful as Don Vargas. Camila advises Aljarafe to be just as scared of her as he is of her husband and offers him a piece of her overall profits.</p><p>Back in the van, Teresa and James take further steps to complete the drug deal. The buyer tests the product and confirms that it is 90% pure. James checks the cash, confirming that it isn’t counterfeit. Teresa asks to check the cash herself, feeling that something is amiss. She discovers that some of the money is counterfeit after feeling that some bills are lighter than others. James confronts the buyer, asking to weigh one of the bills to make sure it weighs one gram. After weighing the bill, James confirms that it is counterfeit. James repeats the process with another bill, which is also light. The buyer swears that he knows nothing about the fake bills and questions one of his associates. Teresa tells the men to check the associate’s car, where the real money is discovered. Teresa says they should just let the man go but instead he is executed.</p><p>James takes Teresa to meet with Camila. Impressed with her actions, Camila presents Teresa with a Rolex, which Teresa declines. Camila shares with Teresa her own struggles after leaving Mexico. She tells Teresa that mercy for someone who stole from her is never an option.</p><p>Once again in the holding cell, Teresa reflects on her relationship with Guero. Meanwhile, Brenda and Tony board a bus to take them across the border. Camila witnesses Teresa calling Brenda on the surveillance cameras.
