Isaac Hayes won an Academy Award for 1971's "Theme from Shaft," and he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005. Isaac released more than 20 studio albums, such as the Gold albums "Hot Buttered Soul" (1969), "Joy" (1973), "Chocolate Chip" (1975), and "Don't Let Go" (1979), and he and David Porter co-wrote the song "Soul Man" (first performed by the soul and R&B duo Sam & Dave), which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.

According to the bankruptcy filings at the time, Hayes owed around $6 million, primarily to a bank. As a result of the bankruptcy, Isaac was forced to vacate his mansion and sell most of his personal possessions, including the royalty and catalog rights to his music.</p><p>At the time of his death in 2008, Isaac was living in a modest house in Memphis, Tennessee. After his death the home went into foreclosure.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Isaac Hayes was born Isaac Lee Hayes Jr. on August 20, 1942, in Covington, Tennessee. He was the son of Isaac Hayes Sr. and Eula Wade, and he had a sister named Willette. He lost his mother at an early age, and Isaac Sr. abandoned the family, so Hayes was raised by his mother's parents. Isaac grew up in family of sharecroppers, and he worked on Tennessee farms during his youth. When Hayes was 5 years old, he started singing at church, and he later taught himself to play the saxophone, organ, piano, and flute. Though Isaac left Manassas High School before graduating, one of his teachers convinced him to earn his diploma, which he completed when he was 21. Several schools offered Hayes music scholarships, but he turned them down to work at a Memphis meat-packing plant in order to provide for his family. At night, he played at juke joints and nightclubs. Isaac landed his first professional gigs in the late '50s, singing at Curry's Club in Memphis.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-247083 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GettyImages-1644552.jpg alt="Isaac Hayes Net Worth" width=594 height=471 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-247083 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Isaac's recording career began in the early '60s when he started working as a session musician for Stax Records. He co-wrote several hit songs with David Porter for Sam & Dave, such as "Soul Man," "Hold On, I'm Comin'," and "You Don't Know Like I Know." Hayes also produced music for Sam & Dave and other Stax Records artists, and he played on Booker T. and The M.G.s' "Winter Snow," which stated "Introducing Isaac Hayes on piano" on the record's label. He released his first album, "Presenting Isaac Hayes," in 1968, and his next four albums, "Hot Buttered Soul" (1969), "The Isaac Hayes Movement" (1970), "â€¦To Be Continued" (1970), and "Black Moses" (1971), reached #1 on the "Billboard" Soul Albums chart. In 1971, Isaac composed music for the soundtrack of "Shaft," which earned him an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. He appeared in the 1974 blaxploitation films "Truck Turner" and "Three Tough Guys" and worked on the soundtracks for both films. In the mid-1970s, Hayes formed the record label Hot Buttered Soul, then he released the 1975 Gold album "Chocolate Chip," followed by the albums "Disco Connection" (1975), "Groove-A-Thon" (1976), and "Juicy Fruit (Disco Freak)" (1976).</p><p>In 1977, Isaac signed with Polydor Records and released the albums "New Horizon" (1977), "For the Sake of Love" (1978), "Don't Let Go" (1979), "Royal Rappin's" (1979), "And Once Again" (1980), and "Lifetime Thing" (1981).

On the series, he performed songs such as "Chocolate Salty Balls," "Love Gravy," and "Make Love, Even When I'm Dead," and he also voiced the character in the 1999 film "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut" and several video games.</p><p>Hayes left "South Park" in March 2006, a few months after the show aired an episode lampooning Scientology, and a statement that was released in his name said, "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins." His son Isaac III later revealed that Hayes' entourage decided that he should quit the show. He told "The Hollywood Reporter" in 2016, "Isaac Hayes did not quit 'South Park;' someone quit 'South Park' for him. What happened was that in January 2006 my dad had a stroke and lost the ability to speak. He really didn't have that much comprehension, and he had to relearn to play the piano and a lot of different things. He was in no position to resign under his own knowledge. At the time, everybody around my father was involved in Scientology â€” his assistants, the core group of people. So someone quit 'South Park' on Isaac Hayes' behalf. We don't know who."</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Isaac married a woman named Dancy in 1960, and after they divorced, he wed Emily Ruth Watson on November 24, 1965. He and Emily welcomed three children, Vincent, Melanie, and Nicole, before divorcing in 1972. Hayes married Mignon Harley on April 18, 1973, and they had two children together, Heather and Isaac III.

He started hosting "The Isaac Hayes and Friends Radio Show" in 1996, and while working at New York City's WRKS, he met vegan chef Elijah Joy, who became his personal chef.</p><p>In 2001, Isaac recorded the album "The Joy Of Creating â€“ The Golden Era Musicians And Friends Play <a href=#>L. Ron Hubbard</a>" with fellow Scientologist <a href=#>Doug E. Fresh</a>.

In Ghana, Isaac was crowned as a chief in honor of his work as a humanitarian and his economic efforts for the country.</p><h2 id=death><strong>Death</strong></h2><p>In March 2006, it was reported that Isaac had suffered a minor stroke two months earlier. His spokeswoman denied the claims, but Hayes confirmed the news in October of that year. On August 10, 2008, a few of Isaac's family members found him unresponsive in his Memphis home next to a treadmill that was still running. After being taken to Baptist Memorial Hospital, Hayes was pronounced dead just after 2 p.m. at the age of 65. Medical examiners later stated that Isaac's death was caused by a recurrence of stroke. Hayes was laid to rest at Memphis' Memorial Park Cemetery.
