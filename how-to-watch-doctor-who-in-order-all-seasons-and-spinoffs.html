Whether you decide to just watch the new series, kicking off with the revival in 2005, or go all in and start right back at the beginning in 1963, you’ll need some guidance on how to navigate through the time vortex.

Originally starring William Hartnell (1963-66) as the character who became known to fans as the First Doctor, the immortal series outlasted the retirement of its leading man to encompass six further stars across its next 26 years — Patrick Troughton’s Second Doctor (1966-69), Jon Pertwee’s Third Doctor (1970-74), Tom Baker’s Fourth Doctor (1974-81), Peter Davison’s Fifth Doctor (1981-84), Colin Baker’s Sixth Doctor (1984-86), and Sylvester McCoy’s Seventh Doctor (1987-89). Following the series’ permanent hiatus in ’89, Paul McGann starred as the Eighth Doctor in a BBC/Fox co-produced TV movie released in 1996.</p><p data-characters=676 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>Despite its quarter-century lifespan and immense popularity, classic Doctor Who never had a fully-fledged spinoff running alongside it, although there was one pilot for an aborted series that made it to broadcast. Aired as a Christmas special, 1981’s K-9 and Company paired up the Doctor’s robot dog with perhaps the most beloved companion of the classic era, Elisabeth Sladen’s Sarah Jane Smith. Although this show failed, both of these characters would get another crack at the whip. Due to its release date, K-9 and Company can be watched in between Tom Baker’s swansong “Logopolis” and Davison’s debut, “Castrovalva.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Who’s up for a Whoniverse?

What’s more, under the auspices of showrunner Russell T. Davies, the series was able to create an interconnected TV universe for the first time.</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>Adult-oriented spinoff Torchwood followed immortal time agent Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman, introduced in Who season 1) investigating extraterrestrial incidents in Cardiff, Wales. Meanwhile, children’s series The Sarah Jane Adventures brought back Sladen’s Sarah Jane (following a guest spot in Who season 2) to solve mysteries with her teenage neighbors in Ealing, London.</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>Here’s how to watch this first phase of the so-called Whoniverse in order:</p><ul data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false><li>Doctor Who seasons 1-2</li><li>Torchwood season 1*</li><li>The Sarah Jane Adventures: “Invasion of the Bane”</li><li>Doctor Who season 3*</li><li>The Sarah Jane Adventures season 1</li><li>Torchwood season 2</li></ul><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=757 data-injectable=true>*Note: If you want to get specific, Torchwood season 1’s two-part finale “Captain Jack Harkness/End of Days” leads directly into the events of Doctor Who season 3’s three-part finale “Utopia/The Sound of Drums/Last of the Time Lords,” with Harkness returning to the parent series for those episodes. Therefore, to get the best chronological experience, you may wish to hold the final episodes of Torchwood season 1 until after Doctor Who: “Blink.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>The Children of Time assemble (2008-2010)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Doctor_Who_The_Stolen_Earth-1.jpg><p data-characters=556 data-current-count=856 data-injectable=true>Back when The Avengers was just a glint in Kevin Feige’s eye, Doctor Who was pulling off its own epic team-up crossover event. In Doctor Who‘s season 4 two-part finale — “The Stolen Earth/Journey’s End” — Davies’ world-building paid off when he united the heroes of the parent series with the casts of Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures in order to foil an invasion of Earth by the Daleks. They even kind of got their own Marvel-like superhero team name, as Davros dubs them “The Children of Time.”</p><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>With the crossover potential established, David Tennant’s Doctor went on to appear in an episode of SJA season 3 — “The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith” — which fits into the arc of the Doctor’s impending death that ran through the standalone Doctor Who specials that aired in place of a season in 2009. Meanwhile, Torchwood revamped its format from a 12-part plot-of-the-week series to a five-part event miniseries titled Children of Earth.

Thanks to the character’s creator — Wallace & Gromit writer Bob Baker — retaining the rights to the character, this spinoff was created without the involvement of the BBC. It was broadcast on Network Ten in Australia and on Disney XD in the U.K. and in Europe, but did not receive an airing in North America. It was cancelled after a single 22-episode season due to poor reception. Watch it if you dare.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Class dismissed (2010-2017)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/doctor-who-matt-smith-karen-gillan-arthur-darvill-alex-kingston-e1692296387717.jpg><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=800 data-injectable=true>2010 was a year of transformative change for Doctor Who as the series said goodbye to both Tennant and Davies, with Steven Moffat stepping up as showrunner and Matt Smith joining as the Eleventh Doctor, remaining at the TARDIS’ controls for three seasons, including the show’s major 50th anniversary celebrations. In 2014, Peter Capaldi took over as the Twelfth Doctor for another three seasons, although this included a year without any new episodes (bar the Christmas special) in 2016.</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>With Moffat in charge of the flagship, connections between Who and its spinoffs largely dried up. However, there was one major exception, as Matt Smith guest starred in The Sarah Jane Adventures story “The Death of the Doctor” in season 4. Sadly, Sladen’s death in 2011 ensured the beloved spinoff ended with its fifth season. As for Torchwood, that revitalized itself again with 10-part miniseries Miracle Day, a U.S./U.K. co-production with Starz. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">This is the final season of Torchwood to date</a>.</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>Lastly, Moffat’s era spawned its one and only original spinoff in the form of 2016’s Class, an eight-part series aimed at a YA/teen audience, set in Shoreditch’s Coal Hill School, a recurring location in Doctor Who. Peter Capaldi guest starred in the pilot, but otherwise the main cast were all original characters.

The duo’s era comprised two regular series and then, as a consequence of the pandemic, a shortened six-part miniseries that replaced season 13 titled Doctor Who: Flux.
