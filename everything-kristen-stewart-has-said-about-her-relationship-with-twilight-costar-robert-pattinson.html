I'm selfish. I'm like, 'That's mine!' And I like to keep whatever is mine remaining that way," Steward said at the time. "It's a funny little game to play, and it's a slippery slope.

She conceded, however, that the intense backlash was difficult to deal with.</p><p>"Speaking very candidly, it was a really traumatic period in my early 20s that kick-started something in me that was a bit more feral," the star said.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Stewart reflected on the breakup in another 2015 interview, calling it "incredibly painful."</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart in 2011. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Steve Granitz/WireImage</span></span></figure><p>"It was incredibly painful.

"It's that I don't want to become a part of a story for entertainment value."</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>In 2019, Stewart said she and Pattinson didn't have any role models for their relationship.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart in 2011. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Dave M.

When reflecting on her time filming the "Twilight" movies, the radio host told Stewart that he thought <a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link>falling in love on set</a> is "the biggest mistake an actor can make."</p><p>"There was nothing I could do," the "Personal Shopper" star replied with a laugh.</p><p>Stewart went on to talk about the media attention on her and Pattinson and said it was "weird'" to be honest about the relationship now.</p><p>"I have this fear that people would assume that maybe I'm, like, you know — it's kind of attention-y, like, 'Oh, cool, you're still, like, pushing that narrative' or whatever," Stewart <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>told Stern</a>. "It's like, no, I've actually never been allowed to just say what happened. Because I was so self-conscious about seeming like an attention-seeker."</p><p>Stewart went on to shut down the popular theory that she and Pattinson were only together as part of a publicity stunt.</p><p>"We were together for years," she said, calling Pattinson her "first" love.</p><p>"Yeah, I mean, like, I was super in love with my high-school boyfriend. Super, super fucking in love with him," Stewart continued. "But me and Rob were, like, a little older, and it was just like, 'gu-gung.'"</p><p>Even though the two had been broken up for several years at the time of the interview, Stewart still agreed with Stern when the radio host called Pattinson a "charming guy."</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Over ten years after they first started dating, Stewart recalled swooning after kissing Pattinson for the first time.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-only><span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Summit Entertainment / Lionsgate</span></span></figure><p>During an interview with the New Yorker in 2021, Stewart said <a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link>she literally swooned when she kissed Pattinson</a> during "Twilight" auditions.</p><p>Numerous actors hoping to be cast as Edward participated in a chemistry read with Stewart (who'd already been chosen to play Bella) at director Catherine Hardwicke's house.</p><p>And when she asked by the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>New Yorker</a> about Pattinson's audition, Stewart mimicked a swoon: "I was literally just, like ..."</p><p>The two also bonded over their approach to playing Edward and Bella.</p><p>"[Pattinson had an] intellectual approach that was combined with 'I don't give a fuck about this, but I'm going to make this sing.'
