In his first video three years ago, Dan shared with us his desire to learn English. He gave us a tour of his apartment and showed us a list of his monthly expenses. Through broken English, he made us fall in love with him. He and Suzy are VERY funny, always laughing and making up songs. We’ve watched their English improve and have been entertained by Dan’s big heart. When the couple goes shopping, we learn that Dan is very frugal and practical. They are quite concerned with eating healthy and not being materialistic, something many of us can relate to. Watching his channel, we can see hope for humanity and perhaps learn the value of being more mindful and esoteric.</p><h3 id=tangerine-travels data-injectable=false>Tangerine Travels</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=791 data-current-count=1091 data-injectable=true>The couple on Tangerine Travels, Maddie and Jordan, packed up their little orange Prius (hence, Tangerine Travels), with all of their belongings and moved to Mexico. They travel all around Mexico with their dog Liska, renting apartments and polishing up their Spanish-speaking skills. The channel is extremely informative regarding Mexican customs, safely traveling in Mexico, currency conversion, receiving health care, and easily avoidable pitfalls. But the couple is also very entertaining as well. They’ve been open about personal health concerns and relationship issues. Recently they broke up but continue to make videos together. They do make it back to the U.S. as often as possible and their series on traveling in Las Vegas is a MUST for anyone thinking of visiting Sin City.</p><h3 id=lone-fox data-injectable=false>Lone Fox</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=true>Lone Fox, aka Drew, started his channel three years ago.

Her skeptical analyses of internet content and media are worth a watch to anyone seeking to understand trends in social behaviors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZq2glWKvpr%2FTZrCoraSqr6Z5wqGYp6aVocBuss6rZJqcpaHBtHs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./will-there-be-another-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-in-2023.html>&#171;&nbsp;Will there be another Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special in 2023?</a>
