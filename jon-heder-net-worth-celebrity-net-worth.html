Heder's net worth?</strong></h2><p>Jon Heder is an American actor and filmmaker who has a net worth of $10 million dollars. Jon Heder first became famous thanks to his portrayal of the titular character in the 2004 comedy film "Napoleon Dynamite." He went on to enjoy a highly-successful film career. Heder appeared in dozens of movies between 2015 and 2018. His notable other films include "Just Like Heaven," "The Benchwarmers," "Blades of Glory," and "School for Scoundrels." Heder has also lent his voice to such animated children's movies as "Surf's Up" and "Monster House," as well as television programs such as "Pickle and Peanut." Jon somewhat retreated from Hollywood around 2018, though he continues to perform periodically.</p><h2 id=napoleon-dynamite-salary><strong>Napoleon Dynamite Salary</strong></h2><p>Jon Heder famously was only paid $1,000 for his work in "Napoleon Dynamite." That looked like quite a bargain after the movie went on to earn $44.5 million at the box office.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Jon Heder was born in 1977 in Fort Collins, Colorado, the son of Helen and physician James. He is of Swedish descent, and has five siblings: identical twin brother Dan, older brother Doug, older sister Rachel, and younger brothers Adam and Matt. When Heder was around two years of age, the family moved to Salem, Oregon, where he went to Walker Middle School and South Salem High School. At the latter institution, he was a member of the drama club and swim team, and also was an Eagle Scout. After graduating, Heder enrolled at Brigham Young University, from which he graduated in 2002. While at BYU, he befriended Jared Hess, and starred in his short film "Peluca."</p><h2 id=breakthrough-with-8220napoleon-dynamite8221><strong>Breakthrough with "Napoleon Dynamite"</strong></h2><p>In 2004, Heder achieved major recognition for his breakthrough starring role in the hit independent film "Napoleon Dynamite." Adapted from "Peluca" by Jared Hess, it features Heder as the highly awkward title character, a high school student dealing with a number of quirky acquaintances and personal dilemmas. After premiering at the Sundance Film Festival in January, "Napoleon Dynamite" went on to become a massive financial success when it was released that June, grossing $46 million on a budget of only $400,000. Heder received numerous accolades for his performance, including MTV Movie Awards for Best Breakthrough Performance and Best Musical Sequence. Additionally, he earned several nominations from the Teen Choice Awards. The film went on to become a cult favorite, and spawned a short-lived animated series on Fox.</p><h2 id=further-film-career><strong>Further Film Career</strong></h2><p>Following his success with "Napoleon Dynamite," Heder had a supporting role as a new-age bookstore clerk in the 2005 romcom "Just Like Heaven," starring <a href=# title="Reese Witherspoon Net Worth">Reese Witherspoon</a> and <a href=# title="Mark Ruffalo Net Worth">Mark Ruffalo</a>.
