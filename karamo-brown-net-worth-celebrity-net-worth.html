In 2019, he returned to Florida A&M and collaborated with HomeGoods to redesign Gibbs Hall's student lounge, where he spent time as a student. After college, Brown worked in social services for 10 years.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 2004, Karamo became the first openly gay black man to join the cast of a reality show when he began starring on "The Real World: Philadelphia." In 2005, he competed on "Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Inferno II," and in 2007, he guest-starred on "The DL Chronicles."

In 2010, Karamo added to his family, adopting Jason's half-brother, Chris, and they moved to Los Angeles the following year. In May 2018, Brown proposed to director Ian Jordan after eight years of dating. His "Queer Eye" co-stars were all in attendance to celebrate the engagement, which took place at HYDE Sunset in Los Angeles the day after Jordan's birthday. The couple split up in mid-2020, and during an appearance on "The <a href=# title="Ellen DeGeneres Net Worth">Ellen DeGeneres</a> Show" a few months later, Karamo stated, "We were distracted by so much â€” with the kids, and our careers â€” that during that time, I had to really say, how is our communication?
