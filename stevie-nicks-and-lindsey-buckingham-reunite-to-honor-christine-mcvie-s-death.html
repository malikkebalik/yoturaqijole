The musician’s family announced that the 79-year-old “passed away peacefully” following <a href=#>a brief illness</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_119>Shortly after McVie’s death, Stevie Nicks shared an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> tribute to her bandmate. “A few hours ago I was told that my best friend in the whole world since the first day of 1975, had died,” Nicks wrote. “I didn’t even know she was ill… until late Saturday night. I wanted to be in London; I wanted to get to London – but we were told to wait. So, since Saturday, one song has been swirling around in my head, over and over and over. I thought I might possibly get to sing it to her, and so, I’m singing it to her now.” She shared the lyrics to the song “Hallelujah” by HAIM, written in her own handwriting.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_82>Former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsey Buckingham also posted an emotional tribute to his friend. “Christine McVie’s sudden passing is profoundly heartbreaking,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> in a photo of a handwritten note. “Not only were she and I part of the magical family of Fleetwood Mac, to me Christine was a musical comrade, a friend, a soul mate, and a sister. For over four decades, we helped each other create a beautiful body of work and a lasting legacy that continues to resonate today.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Christine McVie’s sudden passing is profoundly heartbreaking.

They joined Fleetwood Mac as a couple, but broke up shortly after. Many of the band’s greatest hits are about their roller-coaster <a href=#>relationship and bitter breakup</a>. They haven’t hesitated to call each other out in interviews, either: Nicks has called her ex-boyfriend a <a href=#>“very powerful, controlling man,”</a> while Buckingham has said it was <a href=#>“stupid” of him</a> to convince Fleetwood Mac to let Nicks join the band.</p><p id=par-10_55>In January 2018, Fleetwood Mac fired Buckingham. The guitarist has expressed his belief that Nicks was responsible for his firing. “It would be like a scenario where Mick Jagger says, ‘Either Keith [Richards] goes or I go,’” Buckingham told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Times</a>. “But I guess the singer has to stay. The figurehead has to stay.”</p><p id=par-11_81><a href=#>The “Dreams” singer</a> has vehemently denied responsibility for Buckingham’s firing. In a September 2021 statement to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>, Nicks wrote, “To be exceedingly clear, I did not have him fired, I did not ask for him to be fired, I did not demand he be fired. Frankly, I fired myself. I proactively removed myself from the band and a situation I considered to be toxic to my well-being. I was done. If the band went on without me, so be it.”</p><p id=par-12_51>In 2019, Buckingham had triple bypass surgery following a heart attack. He said Nicks contacted him after the procedure, but he hadn’t heard much from her since. But the former couple was able to set aside their differences to celebrate the life of their beloved friend and former bandmate, Christine McVie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAtbHVopxmppmYuLR5y6KlnauVrnqjwcKkoKefmJa6br7ErqWirJVitbC6zqtknKCinsC1tc2eZKabpp6ytHnDnpitoF6dwa64jg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./hugh-grant-is-angry-he-turned-down-a-role-that-could-win-colin-firth-an-oscar.html>Hugh Grant is angry he turned down a role that could win Colin Firth an Oscar&nbsp;&#187;</a></div></section><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
