But let’s be honest: having a tight and supportive group of friends definitely gives you an advantage. <a href=#>Beyonce has a small group of friends</a> who she knows that she can count on no matter what. So just who is in Beyonce’s exclusive squad?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/beyonce-friends.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gwyneth Paltrow</h2><p id=par-3_48>Beyonce met actress Gwyneth Paltrow several years at a charity event in New York City. In 2010, <a href=#>Paltrow spoke about her relationship</a> with the singer, telling Ellen DeGeneres that Beyonce and her husband, Jay-Z are “incredible people.” The actress elaborated, stating: “They’re very, very kind, generous, good people.”</p><p id=par-4_48>Beyonce has also talked about their relationship. In 2011, the Lemonade singer told Harper’s Bazaar: “She pushes her boundaries all the time. You go to her house and she makes you feel like you never want to go home. She is what I strive to be one day.”</p><p id=par-5_48>When Beyonce released Lemonade in 2016, some fans thought that Paltrow might be “Becky with the good hair” in the song Sorry. Many fans believe that “Becky” had an affair with Jay-Z. Paltrow’s rep responded to the rumors saying that the claims were “completely absurd and 100% false.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kelly Rowland</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-6_37>Kelly Rowland is one of Beyonce’s closest and oldest friends. The two met when they were young girls living in Houston, Texas. At some point, Rowland began living with Beyonce’s family due to family troubles at home.</p><p id=par-7_26>In the early 90s, the girls <a href=#>joined the group Girl’s Tyme</a>. The group performed on Star Search and ultimately signed a record deal with Columbia Records.</p><p id=par-8_35>Later, the duo split from Girl’s Tyme and formed Destiny’s Child, that would later include Michelle Williams as well. This change would propel the girls into superstardom and ultimately make Beyonce who she is today.</p><p id=par-9_72>Though Destiny’s Child broke up in 2005, Beyonce has remained friends with both of the girls but has a particularly close relationship with Rowland. Rowland told E! News that their children are extremely close, adding: “It’s the sweetest thing. It’s the greatest thing about friendship when you’re able to grow up together and your children are able to grow up together and it’s just years upon years of beautiful friendship and sisterhood.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Solange</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_30>It’s one of the greatest gifts to call your sister your best friend. There is no doubt that Beyonce has a very close relationship with her <a href=#>younger sister Solange Knowles</a>.</p><p id=par-11_46>Though we’ll never forget that video or Solange wildly attacking Jay in an elevator after attending the Met Gala in 2014, the three have moved beyond the incident. Beyonce and Solange are each other’s biggest supporters and can be constantly seen cheering each other on. &nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_78>During a <a href=#>joint interview</a> the singers did with Interview in 2017, Beyonce told her sister: “I’m your biggest fan and I’m super proud of you.” When the superstar asked her sister what she was like as an older sister, Solange responded: “You did a kicka** job. You were the most patient, loving, wonderful sister ever. In the 30 years that we’ve been together, I think we’ve only really, like, butted heads … we can count on one hand.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Other notable friends</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-13_36>Beyonce has referred to <a href=#>Michelle Obama</a> as close personal friends in the past. Though it’s unclear whether the former First Lady is a part of Bey’s inner circle, Beyonce definitely has a strong connection with Obama.</p><p id=par-14_89>It is uncertain whether Beyonce and Jay-Z met Michelle and Barack Obama before Beyonce was invited to sing at President Obama’s inauguration. What is clear is that the couples have been long-time admirers of each other. When Michelle was named as one of Time’s 100 most influential people, Beyonce wrote of her relationship with her: “I’m honored to know such a brilliant black woman who’s spoken about the sacrifice it takes to balance her passions while remaining a supportive partner and mother, and now a best-selling author with Becoming.”</p><p id=par-15_52>Beyonce is also close friends with former Destiny’s Child member Michelle Williams. Williams joined the group later than Rowland but was a member of the group until it broke up in 2005. Beyonce still hangs out with Williams and has posted multiple pictures of the two singers on her personal Instagram page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqbuMmqmeZZKaxrC6wp6qZpucpMCmv9NmnauhlaOxtHrHraSlZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-plays-wendy-in-peter-pan-wendy.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who plays Wendy in Peter Pan &amp;amp; Wendy?</a>
