It was the strangest thing and it normally wouldn’t have been an investigation for NCIS, but one of the victims was a Navy bigwig. He called in a few favors. His people contacted NCIS for him.</p><p>They basically made NCIS take the case and they weren’t the only ones investigating a prank. The Navy even sent in Boom Boom. The Navy bomb specialist was brought in to find evidence of the missing tires. He thought the whole situation was laughable. He didn’t see why he had to investigate a prank and, while it was very high tech, it was pretty harmless.</p><p>No one was hurt. Their security feeds all went down before their tires were taken and so this sounds like a prank pulled off by a kid. This same kid was suspected in the theft of spoons from five houses on the same night. He or she were also behind several other pranks that were again harmless. But this person managed to tick off Boom Boom. They stole his van with the evidence he collected. They left it a block away and they sent off elephant toothpaste inside of the van. It lit up with foam.</p><p>It also destroyed evidence on top of injuring Boom Boom’s pride. They made it personal for Boom Boom. He now wants revenge. Everyone else found it funny.</p><p>Kai couldn’t stop smiling and he was already on the outs with Boom Boom. They bonded on the last case however they seemed to be back at square one with this one because Boom Boom just likes messing with him. Boom Boom was as bad as Bam Bam. Only they investigated the elephant toothpaste. They found out it was a small explosion that was expertly done.</p><p>They also learned that it used a lot of yeast as its catalyst. They checked the local commissary of who got a bunch of yeast before they used it and it was connected back to Lt. Commander William Morrison.</p><p>Not that Morrison knew what they were talking about when they came to question him. They asked him about the missing golf trophies, the missing mannequins, and the missing tires. Morrison had thought they were joking at first until they opened his garage. They found all the stolen items there and so that’s when Morrison claimed it was him. He did it.</p><p>But Tennant knew better. Tennant made him tell the truth and it was actually his teenage son behind all the thefts. His son’s name is Robbie. Robbie was lashing out against authority figures. He started doing that after his parents divorced. He’s been looking for a fight ever since. He was smart. He just didn’t know how to channel that intelligence into something worthwhile. He instead used it for pranks. He started pranking people after his dad was deployed and Morrison had just gotten back.</p><p>Morrison noticed that his camper van was missing. He figured Robbie had taken it and so NCIS went looking for that camper van. They found it at an airfield. They also spotted Robbie right before he flew off on a small plane. Robbie had apparently gotten his pilot license recently. He wanted to be like his dad who was also a pilot. Robbie may have escaped in the plane, but someone wasn’t done with them because his dad was later beaten up and sent to the hospital. NCIS thought it was because of something Robbie did.</p><p>They simply didn’t know who he ticked off enough to earn reprisals. Robbie came back to visit his dad at the hospital. Tennant was waiting for him and she used their time together to question him. She wanted to know what kind of trouble he got himself into. She had Robbie tell her about every single theft he ever pulled off. He stole a puppy. Not just any puppy. A puppy from a dog breeder who breeds his dogs for fights and so that puppy could cost thousands of dollars. And Robbie took it because he always sides with the underdogs.</p><p>Robbie knew who was behind the assault on his dad. He didn’t tell NCIS because he snuck away from juvie and he wanted to go after the man himself. Robbie thought he was doing something by freeing the dogs, but the dogs were dangerous. They’ve been in dogfights for a while. Kai thankfully knows how to navigate around dangerous dogs. He even rescued Robbie from one and they arrested Androv. Androv tried to kill Robbie by throwing him in a dog pen and that’s considered attempted murder.</p><p>As for Robbie, they worked out a deal in which he serves his community service by helping Boom Boom and Bam Bam.</p><p>Tennant’s son heard back from his first choice. He got into the Naval Academy and so he was going to Annapolis in the fall. But Whistler was able to turn someone into a CI with Tennant’s help and now she can’t stop this man from calling her in all hours of the day. Kenny wants to continue to serve.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnnpi2tHnHmq6aoZliv6avwKlkaWtdZoBufpJmqp6Zo6S7bn6Mnqeiq5%2BZsm59lWadmqWZocZuwMieqmg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./nyt-wait-until-late-september-or-october-to-get-your-covid-booster.html>&#171;&nbsp;NYT: Wait until late September or October to get your Covid booster</a>
