Jimmy Kimmel is probably most famous for hosting the late night comedy talk show "Jimmy Kimmel Live" for which he earns an annual salary of $15 million. He has hosted the show since 2003. Previously he co-hosted "The Man Show" and was a sidekick on "Win <a href=# title="Ben Stein Net Worth">Ben Stein</a>'s Money."
