Flight Plane Crash Near Stagecoach | News</h1><div id=sub-header>September 2024 · 10 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>A new federal report says parts of the right wing on a medical transport plane that crashed last month in rural Nevada, killing all five people aboard, fell far from the main wreckage site.</p><p>The Associated Press reports that the National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary findings released Wednesday could support the agency's initial theory that the aircraft had broken apart before hitting the ground. NTSB is expected to release its final report with a probable cause within two years.</p><p>The agency says parts of the plane's right wing were located as far as three-quarters of a mile (1.1 kilometers) from where the single-engine Pilatus PC12 crashed in Stagecoach, Nevada, a rural community of about 2,500 residents outside of Reno.</p><p>Authorities have said the Care Flight&nbsp;<a href=#>piloted by Scott Walton</a>, 46, was headed from Reno to Salt Lake City when it crashed around 9:15 p.m. on Feb. 24 amid a winter storm. Care Flight is a service of REMSA Health, and its aviation vendor is Guardian Flight.</p><p>Guardian Flight said in a statement Wednesday it was reviewing the report and assessing ways to strengthen its safety protocols.</p><p>“The safety and well-being of our patients and crew is our utmost priority and we will continue to make significant investments to bolster our commitment," the company said.</p><p>The other victims also included 69-year-old patient Mark Rand and his 66-year-old spouse Terri Rand, as well as two medical crew members, Edward Pricola, 32, and Ryan Watson, 27.</p><p>Walton contacted air traffic control minutes before the crash to report that the plane was climbing past 15,400 feet (4,694 meters), according to the report. But no further radio transmissions came in from the pilot, the report states.</p><p>Just minutes later, the plane began to fall — dropping about 8,000 feet (2,440 meters) in 30 seconds — before the aircraft's navigation tracking system went dark, according to the report.</p><p>Dan Rose, an aviation attorney retained by relatives of the Rands, told The Associated Press that they hope NTSB will investigate Guardian Flight’s decision to fly instead of waiting for the winter storm to pass. Rose also said Mark Rand’s condition wasn’t life-threatening at the time.</p><p>“I know the family would want the NTSB to look carefully at the two issues,” Rose said Wednesday. “They’re really intertwined.”</p><p>The National Weather Service said it was snowing steadily when the flight left Reno, with winds around 20 mph (30 kph) and gusts up to 30 mph (50 kph). Visibility was under 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) with a cloud ceiling about 2,000 feet (600 meters).</p><p>You can read more in the preliminary report below.&nbsp;</p><a href=# rel=noopener><span class=expand><span class="fas tnt-download"></span> Download PDF </span><img alt="NTSB Preliminary Report" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/2news.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/01/d01971a8-c367-11ed-a0db-077c6b5103be/64121cdd26554.preview.jpg width=1265 height=1638 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><figure class=multimedia-inline-figcaption></figure><p>REMSA Health says they have been deeply&nbsp;touched by the outpouring of support shown to their organization, providers, and staff over the last two weeks.</p><p>Earlier this week,&nbsp;A public memorial service for the victims killed in last month's REMSA Care Flight crash was held at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center.</p><p>As the REMSA Health team and community continues to grieve, they have&nbsp;established the Care Flight Memorial Fund, in which all donations will be directed to support families and colleagues of those on board: <a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" dir=ltr href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://bit.ly/3YxA4wV</a>.</p><p>------</p><p><strong>March 9, 2023:</strong></p><p>Care Flight says three of its four helicopters are back in service after it paused flights in the wake of last month’s deadly plane crash.</p><p>A spokesperson for REMSA says the fourth aircraft will start flying as their operational needs dictate.</p><p>So far, there's no timeline on resuming fixed wing medical transport service.</p><p>A fixed-wing plane, operated by Guardian Flight, crashed on February 24th killing two Care Flight workers, the pilot, a patient and a passenger.</p><p><strong>March 8, 2023:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A public memorial service for the victims killed in last month's REMSA Care Flight crash was held at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center on Wednesday.</p><p>The crew - Care Flight nurse Ed Pricola, Care Flight paramedic Ryan Watson, and Guardian Flight pilot Captain Scott Walton were honored at the service.</p><p>State of Nevada Major General Ondra Berry said that all three crew members made the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>"They were willing to show up and give the best of themselves in the most challenging situations."</p><p>Care Flight presented Watson, Pricola, and Walton with their wings during the memorial.</p><p>For EMS professionals, earning wings is described as the culmination of many years of hard work.</p><p>The National Transportation Safety Board says the flight was on its way to Salt Lake City, but it was only in the air for about 14 minutes before it broke apart midair and crashed near Stagecoach.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Details for tomorrow’s (Wednesday, March 8) memorial procession for the Crew of Care Flight Fixed-Wing 56 for members of the public to pay their respects along the route can be found here: <a href=#>https://t.co/xjNWx25DzI</a> <a href=#>@CityofReno</a> <a href=#>@washoecounty</a> <a href=#>@cityofsparks</a> <a href=#>@REMSAHealth</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/I78Umsu4Mf</a></p>— Truckee Meadows Fire & Rescue (@TMFPD) <a href=#>March 7, 2023</a> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/2news.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/01/d01971a8-c367-11ed-a0db-077c6b5103be/64121cdd26554.preview.jpg><p lang=en dir=ltr>Forever in our hearts, <a href=#>@REMSAHealth</a> Care Flight Fixed-Wing 56 ♥️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gJrv6bhskX</a></p>— Reno Aces (@Aces) <a href=#>March 8, 2023</a><p>Anyone is welcome to share pictures and videos that may be included in public tributes at <strong><a href=#>remsahealth.com/share-a-memory</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Care&nbsp;Flight's Facebook page can be found here:&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>(1) Care Flight | Reno NV | Facebook</a></strong></p><p>Governor Lombardo has ordered flags of the United States and the State of Nevada to be flown at half-staff at the State Capitol and all State public building and grounds beginning at sunrise on Saturday, March 4, 2023.</p><p>The flags will remain at half-staff until the conclusion of the last memorial service honoring the first responders involved in this tragedy.</p><p>--------------------------------</p><p><strong>February 28 Update:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Care Flight does not yet know when it will resume air ambulance flights following last week's deadly plane crash near Stagecoach.</p><p>A spokesperson for REMSA says they have no timeline on when service will resume.
